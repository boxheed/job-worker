# AI Agent Instructions

This repository is a Node.js CLI tool written in TypeScript.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code.
- `tests/`: Contains Vitest unit tests.
- `dist/`: Contains the compiled JavaScript code (generated by `npm run build`).
- `tasks/`: Contains task records.

## Development Workflow

- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm run build` to compile TypeScript to JavaScript.
- Run `npm test` to run unit tests using Vitest.
- Run `npm run dev` to run tests in watch mode.

## Coding Standards

- Use ES Modules (ESM).
- All new features should have corresponding unit tests in the `tests/` directory.
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Imports in `.ts` files should use `.js` extensions for compatibility with Node.js ESM after compilation.

## CLI Execution

The main entry point for the CLI is `src/index.ts`, which is compiled to `dist/index.js`.
The package is designed to be executable via `npx` or by installing it globally.
